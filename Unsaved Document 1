/*
  specify test targets in file, and pick them up automaticially...
      (resolve, then look for test.json
        then, when you say > meta-modular test dominictarr/remap/test/remap.asynct
        if finds the test and knows what the target is.
        you chould shorten it to dominictarr/remap
        since the test is certainly in the test folder.
        however, you may want to refur to a specific test.        
      )

  this is a high level command invoked when someone adds a project,
  
  so they'll invoke something like
  > meta-modular add tests project_dir
  
  it will then look in project_dir for test.json or test/test.json
  
  and then add all the tests.
